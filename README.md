<h3>Learning FastAI by experiments</h3>

This repo contains notebooks that I tried creating while I am learning the FastAI library. 

Each chapter of the book will be in its folder with the following notation:
<strong>chapter_<num></strong>

Sometimes each chapter might contain multiple notebooks so they might be ordered with the following notation:
<strong>chap_<num>_exp_<num></strong>

And <b>each folder has its own README.md</b> file that will contain all the learning associated with that chapter including each experiment and it's details.

Also, all the learnings are also shared on my blog <a href="https://ravichandraveeramachaneni@github.io">ravichandraveeramachaneni@github.io</a>. And, it contains the same experiments in the form of the github gist.
