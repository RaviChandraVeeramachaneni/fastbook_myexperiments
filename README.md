<h3>Learning FastAI by experimentation</h3>

This repo contains notebooks that I tried creating while I am learning the FastAI library. 

Each chapter of the book will be in its folder with the following notation:
<strong>chapter_num</strong>

Sometimes each chapter might contain multiple notebooks. So, they might be named with the following notation:
<strong>chap_num_exp_num</strong>

And <b>each folder has its own README.md</b> file that will contain all the learning associated with that chapter including each experiment and it's details.

Also, all the learnings are shared on my blog <a target="_blank" href="https://ravichandraveeramachaneni.github.io/">https://ravichandraveeramachaneni.github.io/</a>. And, it contains the same experiments in the form of the github gist.
